### Core Skills

The harness itself — setup, workflow, and maintenance for a repo under standardized AI-assisted development.

| Skill                   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **bigin-harness-setup** | Scaffolds an AI workflow harness into a repo — `CLAUDE.md`, path-scoped rules, and enforcement gates. Profiles: `nuxt`, `go`, `nodejs`, `next`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **task-workflow**       | On-demand task workflow skill (`/task-workflow`): scope → spec → plan file (approved) → implement/verify loop (capped, independent verifier) → review → cleanup. Loaded only when invoked, not on every session start.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **nuxt-scaffold**       | Scaffolds a Nuxt 4 BFF app from scratch via a deterministic Node.js script (`scripts/scaffold.mjs`, config-driven, zero prompts, macOS/Windows) — `npm create nuxt@latest` + BFF preset + config/sample code. No GitHub clone. / Scaffold app Nuxt 4 BFF bằng script Node.js tất định — không prompt khi chạy.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **next-scaffold**       | Scaffolds a Next.js App Router BFF app from scratch via a deterministic Node.js script (`scripts/scaffold.mjs`, config-driven, zero prompts, macOS/Windows) — `create-next-app` + BFF preset (Zustand, TanStack Query, shadcn/ui, iron-session, Zod, Vitest) + config/sample code. No GitHub clone; `dashboard`/`saas` templates layer official shadcn/ui blocks instead.                                                                                                     |
| **go-scaffold**         | Scaffolds a production-ready Go REST API via a deterministic Node.js script (`scripts/scaffold.mjs`, CLI-flag driven, zero prompts) — contract-first: `openapi.yaml` → server interface + models (`oapi-codegen`), SQL → typed queries (`sqlc`); chi router, Postgres, structured logging, rate limiting, CORS, Prometheus metrics. The script runs codegen + `go build`/`vet`/`test` itself before committing.                                                               |
| **nodejs-scaffold**     | Scaffolds a production-ready Node.js REST API via a deterministic Node.js script (`scripts/scaffold.mjs`, CLI-flag driven, zero prompts) — contract-first: `openapi.yaml` → API types (`openapi-typescript`), `src/db/schema.ts` → migration SQL (`drizzle-kit`, the reverse direction of sqlc); Fastify, Postgres (`postgres`/postgres.js), Zod validation, rate limiting, CORS. The script runs codegen + `pnpm lint`/`type-check`/`build`/`test` itself before committing. |
| **sprint-distill**      | End-of-sprint distillation: merged PRs + touched `knowledge/` concepts → proposal-first `knowledge/` and `bigin-skills` updates. Compresses, never just appends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **write-tests**         | On-demand test authoring (`/write-tests`): style-matches the nearest existing test file, lists edge cases before coding, TDD-orders business logic, mocks only true I/O boundaries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **debug-workflow**      | On-demand systematic debugging (`/debug-workflow`): four gated phases — root cause investigation → pattern analysis → hypothesis testing → fix + validation. For untracked debugging (flaky tests, stack traces, incidents), not tracked bug fixes (see task-workflow) or test authoring (see write-tests).                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **model-router**        | Scores a task against a deterministic rubric (files touched, contract/schema risk, test coverage, reversibility, architectural-decision judgment) and routes it to one of three subagents — `quick-executor` (haiku/low), `standard-worker` (sonnet/high), `deep-architect` (opus/high) — spawned via the Agent tool. Routes down as well as up, so a trivial fix doesn't get an overthinking high-effort pass.                                                               |

### Handoff Skills

Add-ons for a specific cross-role handoff (e.g. designer → developer). Not required for the core harness — opt in per project as the relevant handoff comes up.

| Skill                     | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **session-handoff**       | Saves session state (tasks, decisions, uncommitted changes) to `SESSION.md` and restores it on resume.                                                                                                                                            |
| **nuxt-ui-figma-handoff** | Turns a Nuxt UI Figma design handoff into code — global tokens into `main.css` (`@theme`, `--ui-radius`), semantic color roles and per-component Tailwind Variants overrides into `app.config.ts`. Requires a Figma file/frame URL from the user. |

### Addon Skills

Opt-in capabilities that aren't tied to a cross-role handoff or the core harness workflow — standalone, invoked only when the specific need comes up.

| Skill        | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **oss-port** | Reimplements ("clones") an existing project — usually open source — into a different tech stack via a gated, spec-first workflow: license check → reference setup → behavioral inventory (`FEATURES.md`) → contract extraction (OpenAPI/CLI/API/views) → target scaffold → vertical slice (patterns gate) → module-by-module port → parity report (`PARITY.md`). |

## bigin-harness-setup

Sets up a consistent "harness level" on any repo so team members of mixed skill levels produce consistent, maintainable output.

### Principles

- **Guidance defines intent; gates enforce it mechanically.** Anything left to judgment varies by skill level — so the value is in the gates, not more docs.
- **Single source of truth.** Reference shared rules, never duplicate them.
- **No overhead.** Lean, scannable markdown — a rule nobody reads is worse than no rule.
- **Additive-first cross-repo contract.** `openapi.yaml` is the contract between frontend and backend. Backend leads with backward-compatible changes; a breaking change requires a version bump. Frontend generates types from `openapi.yaml` — never hardcoded.
- **Three-tier loading.** CLAUDE.md is always loaded (≤60 lines). Rule files in `.claude/rules/` carry `paths:` frontmatter so they load only when matching files are in context. On-demand skills (like `/task-workflow`) load only when invoked. Always-loaded target: ~600 tokens for CLAUDE.md alone; worst-case with active paths ~1,750 tokens.

### Profiles

| Profile  | Stack                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nuxt`   | Nuxt 4 fullstack (Cloudflare Pages), Nuxt ESLint, Pinia + Pinia Colada, VueUse, Nuxt UI, nuxt-auth-utils, Zod, Vitest — BFF proxy layer (no D1/KV/R2; backend owns data). Empty repo → scaffolded by the `nuxt-scaffold` skill (`npm create nuxt@latest`, no clone) |
| `go`     | Go REST API — contract-first (`oapi-codegen` + `sqlc`), chi router, Postgres. Empty repo → scaffolded by the `go-scaffold` skill                                                                                                                                    |
| `nodejs` | Node.js TypeScript REST API — contract-first (`openapi-typescript` + Drizzle/`drizzle-kit`), Fastify, Postgres. Empty repo → scaffolded by the `nodejs-scaffold` skill                                                                                              |
| `next`   | Next.js App Router fullstack (Vercel), shadcn/ui, Zustand, TanStack Query, iron-session, Zod, Vitest — BFF proxy layer (no ORM/DB driver; backend owns data). Empty repo → scaffolded by the `next-scaffold` skill (`create-next-app`, no clone)                    |

### What gets generated

**nuxt on an empty repo:** the full app is first scaffolded **by the `nuxt-scaffold` skill's deterministic script** — all decisions gathered upfront into a config JSON, then `node scripts/scaffold.mjs --config <path>` runs `npm create nuxt@latest` + the BFF preset modules + config and sample code (`nuxt.config.ts`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `app/`, `server/`, `simple-git-hooks`) with zero prompts. The Nuxt app is a BFF proxy layer — no DB, the backend owns data persistence. The harness governance layer is then overlaid additively.

**go on an empty repo:** scaffolded **by the `go-scaffold` skill's deterministic script** — module path + project name gathered upfront as CLI flags, then `node scripts/scaffold.mjs --module <path>` writes the project, runs `oapi-codegen` (from `openapi.yaml`) and `sqlc` (from `internal/store/queries/*.sql`) via `go run pkg@version` (no global install, no `go.mod` pollution), writes the hand-written glue (`cmd/server`, `internal/config`, `internal/server`), then `go mod tidy` + `gofmt` + `go vet` + `go build` + `go test` + `git commit` — all before reporting success. `go-scaffold` writes no `.claude/` anything; the harness governance layer is overlaid additively afterward, same as nuxt.

**nodejs on an empty repo:** scaffolded **by the `nodejs-scaffold` skill's deterministic script** — project name gathered upfront as a CLI flag, then `node scripts/scaffold.mjs --project <name>` writes the project, `pnpm add`s dependencies, runs `openapi-typescript` (from `openapi.yaml`) and `drizzle-kit generate` (from `src/db/schema.ts` — migrations are generated from the schema, the reverse direction of sqlc), writes the hand-written glue (`src/app.ts`, `src/routes`, `src/services`, `src/repositories`), then `pnpm lint` + `pnpm type-check` + `pnpm build` + `pnpm test --run` + `git commit` — all before reporting success. `nodejs-scaffold` writes no `.claude/` anything; the harness governance layer is overlaid additively afterward, same as go.

**next on an empty repo:** the full app is first scaffolded **by the `next-scaffold` skill's deterministic script** — all decisions gathered upfront into a config JSON, then `node scripts/scaffold.mjs --config <path>` runs `create-next-app` + the BFF preset (Zustand, TanStack Query, Zod, iron-session, Vitest) + `shadcn/ui` (`npx shadcn@latest init` + `add`) + config and sample code (`next.config.ts`, `src/app/`, `src/hooks/`, `simple-git-hooks`) with zero prompts. The `dashboard` template layers the official shadcn `dashboard-01` block; `saas` adds a demo-auth-gated `/dashboard` (`iron-session`) with hand-authored login/signup pages instead of a full GitHub template clone — shadcn/ui has no equivalent gallery of standalone app templates to clone the way `nuxt-ui-templates` does. The Next app is a BFF proxy layer — no DB, the backend owns data persistence. The harness governance layer is then overlaid additively.

### Usage

Trigger in Claude Code with:

```
Set up a harness
Add AI rules to this repo
Thiết lập harness
```

The skill detects the stack profile (or asks), confirms before overwriting anything, and prints onboarding next steps. Re-running on an already-set-up repo is safe (idempotent).

### Enforcement (the load-bearing part)

- **`scripts/pre-commit.sh`** — runs lint + typecheck + tests; fails closed. The skill installs it as a git hook (and `git init`s the repo if needed).
- **`.claude/guards/bash-guard.mjs`** — a `PreToolUse` hook that blocks the agent from weakening its own gates (`--no-verify`, `git commit -n`, force-push to main). `--force-with-lease` on a feature branch is allowed.
- **`.claude/guards/spec-gate-guard.mjs`** — a `PreToolUse` hook that blocks non-trivial `Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit` calls until `PLAN.md` exists with `Status: approved`. Trivial paths (`tests/**`, `*.md`, `.env.example`, common config files) and edits ≤20 lines are exempt.
- **`.claude/guards/injection-scan-guard.mjs` + `.claude/guards/injection-gate-guard.mjs`** — a two-stage prompt-injection defense (inspired by Lasso Security's PostToolUse Defender). The scan guard (`PostToolUse`) heuristically checks `WebFetch`/`mcp__*` responses and `curl`/`wget` Bash output for injected instructions and flags a session-scoped marker; the gate guard (`PreToolUse`) asks for confirmation on the next risky `Bash`/`Write`/`Edit`/`mcp__*` call if that flag is still fresh (5-minute window), then clears it.
- **`.claude/guards/session-resume-check.mjs`** — a `SessionStart` hook that deterministically injects a resume-prompt reminder when `.claude/memory/SESSION.md` has `status: in-progress`, instead of relying on CLAUDE.md prose alone.
- **Auto-format** (nuxt/next) — set up by the `nuxt-scaffold`/`next-scaffold` skill. ESLint is the only formatter (Prettier disabled). A `PostToolUse` hook runs `.claude/guards/lint-fix-file.mjs` after every agent Write/Edit, scoped to just the touched file; humans get the same via `.vscode/settings.json` format-on-save.
- **`.claude/settings.json`** — pre-approves safe profile commands to reduce prompt friction.

## sprint-distill

Replaces a manual NotebookLM end-of-sprint pass with a git-native distillation step: merged PRs + log → sprint-distill → `knowledge/` + `bigin-skills` → knowledge validator gate.

Determines sprint scope from the last entry in `knowledge/log.md` (asks for a start date if there's no bundle yet or no dated entry). Gathers merged PRs since that date, touched concept files, and current `.claude/rules/`, plus any pasted out-of-repo material (meeting notes, transcripts, client docs). Classifies every candidate learning with a strict rule — WHAT/WHY → `knowledge/`, HOW-we-work → `bigin-skills`, neither → dropped and reported, never both — then proposes the full set of changes and **stops** for approval before writing anything. On approval: applies the changes, runs the knowledge validator if present, appends the log entry last.

Trigger with:

```
Sprint distill
Distill this sprint
Chưng cất sprint
```

Doesn't trigger on single-PR or single-change review — use `/code-review` for that.

## Maintaining this repo

**`harness-audit`** — a project-local skill (`.claude/skills/harness-audit/SKILL.md`, not shipped as part of the plugin) that audits this repo's own harness against current official Claude Code docs (skills, hooks, sub-agents, plugins, memory). Findings report only — it never auto-fixes, and it won't trigger from natural language (`disable-model-invocation: true`), so it has to be run explicitly.

Run it with:

```
/harness-audit
```

It fetches the live docs, checks skill frontmatter / hooks / sub-agents / context budget / plugin structure / eval coverage / permissions against them, then **stops** with a findings table and asks whether to act on anything or just log the report. Closed findings are tracked in `.claude/audit-log.md` (created on first run) so re-runs don't re-litigate what's already been fixed.
